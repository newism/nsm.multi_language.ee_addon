NSM Multi Language Samples
==========================

This directory contains a comprehensive example template that demonstrates the NSM Multi Language extension and plugin. Simply copy the "samples/templates/nsm-ml.group" directory to your ExpressionEngine templates directory. By default, this is stored at:

	system/expressionengine/templates

Next copy the "samples/language/nsm\_multi_language" directory into your ExpressionEngine language directory. By default, this is stored at:

	system/expressionengine/language

Once you have done this, you will need to go your ExpressionEngine control panel, and navigate to "Design &gt; Templates &gt; Synchronize Templates". Select the "Submit" button and you should be able to direct your browser to:

	http://YOUR_HOST/index.php?/nsm-ml/
